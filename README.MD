A README file is a document that provides information about a project and its usage. It is usually the first file that a user encounters when they visit a project repository. A good README file should be brief but detailed, and it should contain instructions on how to install and run the project. It can also include information about the projectâ€™s purpose, features, and how to contribute to it.
